## Introduction
This is continution project from the first project (titled as "AML_Project.ipynb"). Taking in feedback for the first project (please see "Project1_Feedback.md"), I will be cleaning this project by focusing my models on unsupervised learning for time-series classification.

In this fictitious scenario, I am a US military data analyst working with data mining, data analytics, and machine learning to understand human tendencies for violence. My job is to train a machine learning algorithim to associate levels of conflict using economic, weather, and geographical features through classification models. Through this ranking system, US stakeholders and decision makers can alocate resources to give ample time for UN peacekeepers and NATO forces to be deployed and minimize civilian casualties. My training dataset will come from "traditional" conflict zones in the Middle East, North Africa, and Ukraine. In addition, my employers have asked me to keep an eye on the American and European embassies in hot regions. We do not want a repeat of 2012 when the members of Ansar al-Sharia killed the US Ambassador to Libya during the Benghazi attack. This will be my step project towards my final project.

Data Usage: Our actual Y values will be taken from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Database (ACLED) by totaling up the number of violent incidents in each country per year from 2000 to 2023. Our starting feature X values will be taken from two APIs: Worldbank and NASA Power. There will be a modest pool related to economic and weather factors.

Machine Learning Pipeline: I will first preprocess the data by cross-validation and principal component analysis to see which components capture the highest amount of variance. Afterwards, I will split the train and test data in an 80:20 ratio and adjust the ratio when needed. I will first run the OLS, Ridge, and LASSO regressions with their respective confusion matrices
