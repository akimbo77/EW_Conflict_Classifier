## Introduction
This is continution project from the first project (titled as "AML_Project.ipynb"). Taking in feedback for the first project (please see "Project1_Feedback.md"), I will be cleaning this project by separating it into two approaches: supervised classification and regression. If I have spare time I will add a third part exploring unsupervised learning.

In this fictitious scenario, I am a US military data analyst working with data mining, data analytics, and machine learning to understand human tendencies for violence. My job is to train a machine learning algorithim to "predict" a possible violent outbreak using economic, weather, and geographical features through "whatever means possible", not limited to a single approach. The main issue is that violence is sporadic and US stakeholders and decision makers only have limited resources (i.e. vehicles, personnel, etc.) to spare in a dynamic, high tense situation. My training dataset will come from "traditional" conflict zones in the Middle East, North Africa, and Ukraine. I will be using a combined dataset taken from hetergenous sources (i.e. ACLED, World Bank, NASA). In addition, my employers have asked me to keep an eye on potential violent outbreak and intensity in the United States, a country that does not experience high levels of violence in comparison to "hot" countries and possibly find "hidden" trends. This is a the true test of the value of my models. 

Data Usage: Our actual Y values will be taken from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Database (ACLED) by totaling up the number of violent incidents in each country per year from 2000 to 2023. Our feature X values will be taken from the Worldbank, NOAA, NASA POWER, OECD, FAOSTAT, FRED, WHO GHO, and EM-DAT. 

Machine Learning Pipeline: I will first start with preprocessing the data by create a merged "mega" dataframe from the different APIs and making sure that there is limited data loss during the merging phase. The next step will be using PCA for reducing dimensionality.
